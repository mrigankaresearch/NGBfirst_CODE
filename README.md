# NGBfirst_CODE
This is upload for submission to The Visual Computer

This is a python colab notebook code for executing the generic version of the algorithm. <br/>
Step 1: Run Part_I.py <br />
Step 2: Run Part_II.py  : This file aligns vertices and faces by removing headers and footers/normal/color etc.<br />
Step 3: Run Part_III.py : This file creates a copy of the vertex matrix, also translate x,y,z by Tx=Ty=Tz to fit into the first quadrant<br />
Step 4: Run Part_IV.py : This file creates Adjacency List <br />
Step 5: Run Part_V.py    This is the main algorithm file // Do not execute Part_V_a or Part_V_b after Part_V. These are to be run separately. <br/>All results are arrived at after running the sequence Part_I.py-->Part_II.py-->Part_III.py-->Part_IV.py-->Part_Va.py-->Part_VI.py <br />  
<br/>For faster execution times the sequence followed is Part_I.py-->Part_II.py-->Part_III.py-->Part_IV.py-->Part_V.py-->Part_VI.py <br />  
To adjust lambda look at line no. 102 and to change number of iteration look into line 35 of Part_V.py <br/>
OR, To adjust lambda look at line no. 163 and to change number of iteration look into line 94 of Part_Va.py <br/>
OR, To adjust lambda look at line no. 165 and to change number of iteration look into line 96 of Part_Vb.py <br/>
Step 6: Run Part_VI.py <br />
Step 7: View obj file in any 3D file viewer such as MeshLab, Blender or https://fetchcfd.com/3d-viewer <br />
