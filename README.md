This is upload for submission to The Visual Computer

This is a python colab notebook code for executing the generic version of the algorithm. <br/>
Step 1: Run Part_I.py <br />
Step 2: Run Part_II.py <br />
Step 3: Run Part_III.py <br />
Step 4: Run Part_IV.py <br />
Step 5: Run Part_V.py    This is the main algorithm file // Do not execute Part_V_a or Part_V_b after Part_V. These are to be run separately. All results are arrived at after running Part_V.py <br />  
To adjust lambda look at line no. 102 and to change number of iteration look into line 35 of Part_V.py
Step 6: Run Part_VI.py <br />
Step 7: Run Part_VII.py <br />
